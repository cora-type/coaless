Description

A web app that simply coalesces the comments in the top searches of a reddit-google search. As Google searches become cluttered with ads and blogposts littered with useless information, Reddit provides honest, real information from users which is why an increasing number of people put Reddit at the end of their Google Searches. The purpose of this app is to save time from clicking link after link in Google.

Known Issues

- PRAW is slow, so the app takes a few seconds to grab the results. Need to find a way to make it faster. Worst case run time so far has been 12 seconds :o

- Clicking a comment source link doesn't work (as a workaround for now just click the post source link)
