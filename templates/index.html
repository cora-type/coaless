            I've never been a big proponent of suicide bombing, but the mattress
          industry is changing my mind. The more I look into buying a mattress,
          the more I want to end my life in a violent way, taking everyone
          involved in the process along with me. It's like.. if you want to buy
          a car, or wrench, or sandwich, you can read around and find a product
          that seems good. But not a mattress. Every mattress company says their
          stuff uses science and technology and it's amazing and will literally
          fix your life. Every professional review says good things about the
          mattress, and better things about the more expensive mattress. Every
          personal review says bad things about the mattress. Any mattress
          someone recommends on here, there's a post saying how this mattress
          will ruin your life. And why are "good" mattresses $5,000? What makes
          the mattress so expensive? Also, you can never test a mattress as long
          as you need to. Laying on a mattress for 10 minutes doesn't tell you
          how it'll be in 8 months. God damn. I want to buy a mattress for
          around 1k too. But at this point I think I'll just find an old one
          covered in blood and slime behind a dumpster and use that. Who cares.
          Buying a new mattress has been the single worst experience of buying a
          new anything in my entire life.
